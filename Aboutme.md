## Projects
### Flyback Converter Used in Power Supply Applications
~~~
<div style= 'text-align: justify;'>

With the assistance of Altium Designer, I successfully created a Flyback Converter project. This converter efficiently produces a 5V output within an input voltage range of 18–36V. The project encompassed every stage of development, from the initial design through implementation. While I diligently worked on the design and testing phases, I must note that the verification of the outputs remains a pending aspect of this project.</div>

### Cuk Converter for Power Supply Applications

~~~
<div style= 'text-align: justify;'>

With Altium Designer, I was able to design and implement a Cuk Converter project that efficiently converts a 4 to 20 volt input range into a stable, reliable 5 volt output. The converter operates at a high switching frequency of 1 MHz, ensuring optimal performance.

As the project manager, I led and coordinated all phases of development, from the design to the final product. By selecting suitable components and developing an effective circuit schematic, I ensured that the converter performed optimally under challenging conditions. I paid close attention to the layout, using robust design rules, in order to minimize noise and interference, which improved its overall efficiency.

After implementing the design, I conducted comprehensive tests to confirm the converter's performance. These tests verified its efficiency, voltage regulation, and overall reliability, with the results meeting or exceeding expectations.

### a Self-Power Smartband for Health Monitoring
~~~
<div style= 'text-align: justify;'>
An ultralow-power IoT wristband with healthcare capabilities such as heart rate measurement, pulse oximetry, ECG waveform, pedometer, and sleep monitoring has been developed. The wristband utilizes an optimized hardware and software design, including a Thermoelectric Generator (TEG) for self-powering.Link.

### LLC Resonant Converter used in solar systems
~~~
<div style= 'text-align: justify;'>
In Altium Designer, I created an LLC resonant converter that can handle input voltages between 350 and 400 volts and produce a consistent 330V at 2A. The following phase is thorough testing, including efficiency, stability, and safety evaluations, to make sure it is appropriate for solar applications.

### Optimizing Auxiliary Power Supplies in Solar Systems

~~~
<div style= 'text-align: justify;'>
The main goal of my project is to maximize solar systems' auxiliary power sources.
I will research soft switching converters to increase efficiency and reliability by reducing voltage and current stress on switches. The goal of this project is to increase the power supply's effectiveness and economy.
